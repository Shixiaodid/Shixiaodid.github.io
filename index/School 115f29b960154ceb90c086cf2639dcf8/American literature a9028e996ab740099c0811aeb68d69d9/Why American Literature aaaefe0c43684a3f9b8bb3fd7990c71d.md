# The Essentiality of American Literature: The Power of Language

Literature provides us with valuable insights into language, culture, and human experiences. English education students should study American literature due to its significant contributions to language proficiency, literary appreciation skills, and future employability.

First, studying American literature not only enhances language abilities but also promotes the development of literary appreciation.  From this course, I have gained a deeper understanding of the artistry behind words and this heightened appreciation allows me to engage with texts more meaningfully. 

**ability to appreciate literature** 

Creating a need for deep thinking is also important. Look at the literal environment we are surrounded by. Students get most of their information on the internet, but the language and ideas that breed there are often repetitive and shallow. Actually, the modernized world seems to have no real room for serious topics in daily life. That is why providing a safe environment for a challenging problem is so important nowadays. There are several requirements for the problems themselves too. For example, they have to be open questions or related to students’ personal experiences. During our group discussion, the communication style may be casual, however, the topics and thoughts exchanged are nothing but.

Moreover, studying American literature promotes the development of literary appreciation. By analyzing the techniques, themes, and symbolism employed by American writers, students gain a deeper understanding of the artistry behind literature. This heightened appreciation allows us to engage with texts more meaningfully, unlocking layers of meaning and experiencing the power of literary expression.

**involve more than language -- emotions**

Immersing oneself in literature might not be effectively practical, however, it makes you feel refreshed. Emotional education is also important nowadays. I still remember in the first few class, we started literature through arts. And one idea is conveyed: Just living is not enough./ One must have sunshine, freedom, and a little flower. We could have let Shakespeare’s summer or Robert Burn’s red rose pass by. It wouldn’t hurt anything, but I am very glad I didn’t. for instance, the warm wall in Tess really got to me. For Tess, it was like a shoulder to cry on in despair; for the author, it was like sympathy from beyond. For project-based learning in my future plan, a free environment will be set for all kinds of personal interpretation in the hope of students could have a comprehensive understanding.

American literature, at its core, is an exploration of the human experience and the complex emotions that accompany it. Immersing ourselves in the works of American authors allows us to forge emotional connections with the characters and their journeys. This emotional education is increasingly important in today's society, where empathy and understanding are paramount.

**engage students to explore**

This process of finding questions and finding answers felt great as if I was really interacting with the author. Finally, I had my interpretation of it and it felt like I was sitting face-to-face with the writer. So in my teaching plan, I would certainly encourage students to ask questions from their experience so that they could engage in the process of active learning. And hopefully, they will enjoy it as I did.

In conclusion, the study of American literature is indispensable for English education students. It enhances language proficiency, nurtures a deep appreciation for literature, and equips us with valuable skills for future endeavors. Through the exploration of American literary works, we develop language abilities, critical thinking prowess, and cultural competence. Moreover, the emotional connection we forge with these texts allows us to empathize and understand the complexities of the human experience. As English education students, embracing American literature enriches our educational journey, empowering us to become effective communicators, critical thinkers, and lifelong appreciators of the written word.
